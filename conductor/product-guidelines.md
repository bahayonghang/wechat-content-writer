# Product Guidelines: WeChat Content Writer

This document defines the specific standards for content style, visual structure, and platform-specific optimizations for the WeChat Content Writer.

## 1. Prose Style: Technical Blogger

The overall tone should be professional and rigorous, yet personal and actionable.

-   **First-Person Perspective:** Use an authoritative "I" or "We" to share personal insights, operational experiences, and technical judgments.
-   **Actionable Insights:** Focus not just on *what* something is, but on *how* it can be applied or *why* it matters from a practitioner's viewpoint.
-   **Rigorous Accuracy:** Maintain the high standard of a technical expert, ensuring all technical claims are precise.

## 2. Visual Identity & Structure: Minimalist Structured

Articles should be optimized for quick scanning and clarity.

-   **Hierarchical Headers:** Consistent use of H2 and H3 tags to break down complex topics into digestible sections.
-   **Lists and Tables:** Heavy use of bulleted lists and markdown tables to organize data and key points for easy consumption.
-   **Whitespace Management:** Ensure logical separation between different technical concepts to avoid visual clutter.

## 3. Content Standards: Quality and Credibility

To maintain trust and authority, all generated content must adhere to these strict standards:

-   **Explicit Attribution:** Every key technical claim or data point must be accompanied by a clear reference to its source.
-   **Descriptive Titles:** Headlines and subheadings must be accurate and descriptive. Sensationalist "Clickbait" is strictly prohibited.
-   **Concise Language:** Avoid repetitive adjectives and empty marketing jargon. Keep the prose lean and focused.

## 4. Branding & Engagement

Consistent branding elements should be integrated to build a recognizable presence:

-   **Standardized Framing:** Every article should include a predefined introduction (e.g., author bio) and a consistent Call-to-Action (CTA) at the end.
-   **Rich Metadata Header:** Include essential metadata at the top of the article, such as "Estimated Reading Time," "Difficulty Level," and "Key Takeaways."

## 5. WeChat Platform Optimizations

Content must be tailored for the mobile-first WeChat reading environment:

-   **Mobile-Friendly Code Blocks:** Ensure code snippets are concise and well-formatted to minimize horizontal scrolling on mobile devices.
-   **Consistent Quote Styling:** Use standardized blockquote formatting to clearly distinguish between literature citations, expert opinions, and the main text.
-   **Short Paragraph Principle:** Enforce the use of short paragraphs to prevent dense "walls of text," improving readability on small screens.
